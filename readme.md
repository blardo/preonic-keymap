# My Preonic Map
Nothing super crazy going on here, and layout isn't final. Gaming layer right now just disables GUI key.

Notable changes:
- Esc = hold for ctrl
- Enter = hold for shift
- Simple media controls on util layer under left Fn (encoder in my case)
- Throttling helper function for knob keys is added to prevent Windows freaking out.
- Encoder works as follows:

    - Default: Scroll up/down
    - Raise: PgUp/Dn
    - Lower: Left/Right
    - Press: Volume Up/Dn
